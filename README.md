# IPod Shuffle 4g Scripts

##shuffle.py

Python script for building the Track and Playlist database for the newer gen IPod Shuffle.
Forked from the [shuffle-db-ng project](https://code.google.com/p/shuffle-db-ng/)

Just put your audio files into the mass storage of your IPod and shuffle.py will do the rest
```bash
$ python shuffle.py -h
usage: shuffle.py [-h] [--disable-voiceover] [--rename-unicode]
                  [--track-gain TRACK_GAIN]
                  path

positional arguments:
  path

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --disable-voiceover   Disable Voiceover Feature
  --rename-unicode      Rename Files Causing Unicode Errors, will do minimal
                        required renaming
  --track-gain TRACK_GAIN
                        Store this volume gain (0-99) for all tracks; 0
                        (default) means no gain and is usually fine; e.g. 60
                        is very loud even on minimal player volume
```

##Tips and Tricks

#### Disable trash for IPod
To avoid that linux moves deleted files into trash you can create an empty file `.Trash-1000`.
This forces linux to delete the files permanently instead of moving them to the trash.
Of course you can also use `shift + delete` to permanently delete files without this trick.

#### Use Rhythmbox to manage your music and playlists
As described [in the blog post](https://nims11.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/ipod-shuffle-4g-under-linux/)
you can use Rythmbox to sync your personal music library to your IPod
but still make use of the additional features this script provides (such as voiceover).

Simply place a file called `.is_audio_player` into the root directory of your IPod and add the following content:
```
name=&quot;Name's IPOD&quot;
audio_folders=iPod_Control/Music/
```

Now disable the IPod plugin of Rhythmbox and enable the MTP plugin instead.
You can use Rythmbox now to generate playlists and sync them to your IPod.
The script will recognize the .pls playlists and generate a proper iTunesSD file.

##### Known Rhythmbox syncing issues
* Creating playlists with names like `K.I.Z.` will fail, because the FAT Filesystem does not support a dot `.` at the end of a directory/file.
* Sometimes bad ID3 tags can also cause corrupted playlists.

In all cases you can try to update Rythmbox to the latest version, sync again or fix the wrong filenames yourself.

#### Carry the script with your IPod
If you want to use this script on different computers it makes sense
to simply copy the script into the IPod's root directory.
